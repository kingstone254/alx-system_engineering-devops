Users and consumers expect their favorite websites and services to be constantly accessible. Have you ever seen Facebook, Amazon, LinkedIn, Ebay down? Probably not. Any downtime means users frustration and potentially millions of dollars in loss. That’s true for the big players but also for any company where its online presence is crucial, which is the case for a lot of businesses.

This does not happen magically. Software engineers are building reliable systems that are supposed to be up and running 100% of the time, but sometimes things go sideways and the issue needs to be fixed as soon as possible. To achieve quick resolution time, companies are putting in place monitoring systems to detect any anomaly and alert the employee who is on-call. This sometimes happens during working hours, but also at 3am or at night.

Setup
To be on call you need at least 4 components:

A service or website you want to monitor
A monitoring tool
An oncall management system
A software engineer (that’s you)
